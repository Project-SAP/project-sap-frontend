This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

# Prerequisites
- NodeJS
- Visual Studio Code (Highly recommedned!)

# Installing and Running Locally
Once the repository is pulled down, run `npm install` to download and install all node dependencies.

Once installation has finished run `npm run dev` to run the API. 
First, run the development server:

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Calling The Backend

Make sure the backend is running. Press `F12` to open the console. Click on the `Make API call` to see the message from the API appear in the console.

# TODOs (move to Jira later???)
- Add testing
  - Jest is a popular node based test package. But needs to be compatible with Express.
- Determine proper proper file layout
